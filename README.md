Sign language gesture recognition plays a vital role in facilitating communication for
the deaf and hard of hearing community. However, communication barriers persist,
particularly in contexts where sign language interpreters may not be readily available.

In recent years, advancements in technology, particularly in the field of deep learning,
have offered promising solutions to address these barriers. Traditional approaches to
sign language gesture recognition often relied on handcrafted feature extraction
methods and machine learning algorithms. While effective to some extent, these
methods often struggled to generalize across diverse gestures and variations in signing
styles. Moreover, they often required extensive manual tuning and were limited in their
ability to capture complex temporal dynamics inherent in sign language. 

This work introduces a novel hybrid approach, CRNN (Convolutional Recurrent Neural
Network), for sign language gesture recognition. Leveraging the strengths of both
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in spatial feature extraction and Recurrent
Neural Networks (RNNs) in temporal modeling, CRNN offers enhanced accuracy and
robustness in recognizing sign language gestures. 

Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed CRNN approach, 
achieving state-of-the-art accuracy in sign language gesture recognition tasks. 
By effectively capturing both spatial and temporal information inherent in sign language 
gestures, the CRNN model demonstrates superior performance compared to traditional 
approaches. These findings underscore the potential of hybrid deep learning architectures in advancing sign
language recognition technology. By automating the process of gesture recognition,
these technologies have the potential to facilitate real-time communication, empower
individuals with hearing impairments, and bridge the communication gap between deaf
and hearing communities.
